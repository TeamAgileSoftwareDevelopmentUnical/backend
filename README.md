## How to run the project.
First of all, clone both the backend and the [frontend](https://github.com/TeamAgileSoftwareDevelopmentUnical/frontend) repositories.

For the backend part we've used this modules and dependencies:
+ Spring Boot
+ Spring Web
+ Spring Security
+ Spring Data JPA
+ Lombok

If you want to check the db with PGAdmin, or whatever viewer, you need to create a new database with the following credentials:
+ username: postgres
+ password: root
+ port: 5432

_To customize these credentials check the `application.properties` file._

Now you are able to run the backend part through running the main method inside `AmazonApplication.java`.ðŸ˜Ž

It should give something like this in your console:

In the `README.md` file of the other repository you can find all the frontend instruction.
